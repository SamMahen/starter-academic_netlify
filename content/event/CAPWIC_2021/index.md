summary: Developing a system for multi-class clinical relation extraction
abstract: "Relation extraction is a natural language processing (NLP) to detect and classify the relation between two entities in a text. Due to the exponential growth of text in recent years, automatic extraction of semantic relations from text has received growing attention. In this work, we explore three deep learning-based approaches for the multi-class classification of relations. The first explores three Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) architectures; one being a novel multi-label architecture. The second utilizes Bidirectional Encoders Representation from Transformers (BERT) language models. The third proposes a hierarchical based approach to remove the influence of the negative instances during the multi-class classification. We evaluate our method on a clinical dataset annotated for medical problems, treatments, and tests; and their relations. We report the precision, recall and $F_1$ scores and compare our method to six current state-of-the-art approaches. Our results show that our novel multi-label CNN architecture obtained a higher F1 score overall and outperforms the other CNN architectures; classes with fewer instances perform better with BERT-based models; and there is a significant improvement in the performance across all three CNN models when applying the hierarchical based approach."
