summary: Exploring different approaches for ADE Extraction
abstract: "Here we describe our teamâ€™s participation in the Tracks
1 & 2 from Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF 2020)
Challenge organized by Cheminformatics Elsevier Melbourne University
for extracting information over chemical reactions from patents. We dis-
cuss our systems: MedaCy, a python-based supervised multi-class entity
recognition system, and RelEx, a python-based relation extraction sys-
tem which includes rule-based and supervised learning pipelines. Our
best model for Task 1 obtained an overall relaxed precision of 0.95 and
exact precision of 0.87; relaxed recall of 0.99 and exact recall of 0.86; and
relaxed F score of 0.97 and exact F score of 0.87. Our best model for
Task 2 obtained an overall precision of 0.80; recall of 0.54; and F score
of 0.65."
