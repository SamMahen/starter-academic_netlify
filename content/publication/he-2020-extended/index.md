abstract: The discovery of new chemical compounds is perceived as a key driver of
  the chemistry industry and many other economic sectors. The information about the
  new discoveries are usually disclosed in sci- entific literature and in particular,
  in chemical patents, since patents are often the first venues where the new chemical
  compounds are publicized. Despite the significance of the information provided in
  chemical patents, extracting the information from patents is costly due to the large
  volume of existing patents and its drastic expansion rate. The Cheminformat- ics
  Elsevier Melbourne University (ChEMU) evaluation lab 2020, part of the Conference
  and Labs of the Evaluation Forum 2020 (CLEF2020), provides a platform to advance
  the state-of-the-arts in automatic in- formation extraction systems over chemical
  patents. In particular, we focus on extracting synthesis process of new chemical
  compounds from chemical patents. Using the ChEMU corpus of 1500 “snippets” (text
  seg- ments) sampled from 170 patent documents and annotated by chemical experts,
  we defined two key information extraction tasks. Task 1 targets at chemical named
  entity recognition, i.e., the identification of chemical compounds and their specific
  roles in chemical reactions. Task 2 targets at event extraction, i.e., the identification
  of reaction steps, relating the chemical compounds involved in a chemical reaction.
  In this paper, we provide an overview of our ChEMU2020 lab. Herein, we describe
  the re- sources created for the two tasks, the evaluation methodology adopted, and
  participants results. We also provide a brief summary of the meth- ods employed
  by participants of this lab and the results obtained across 46 runs from 11 teams,
  finding that several submissions achieve substan- tially better results than the
  baseline methods prepared by the organiz- ers.
