 abstract = {Text mining techniques are useful in extracting
hidden information about the biomedical interactions such as
Protein-Protein, Drug-Drug and Protein-Drug. Recently, there
is an increased interest in automated methods due to the vast
growth in the volume of published text regarding biomedical
interactions. This work mainly focuses on extraction of Drug-
Drug interactions (DDIs) in biomedical research articles from
well-known databases such as DrugBank and MedLine. The
proposed approach is developed based on feature engineering
through natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as
bag-of-words approach, tokenization, part-of-speech (POS)
tagging, lemmatization and so on. This uncomplicated and
easy to implement set of features are combined into a feature
vector which is used to train a machine learning model. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach was measured by
conducting several experiments on the “DDI Extraction 2013”
corpus. The system showed encouraging F-measure value of
76.9%.},
