abstract: Text mining techniques are useful in extracting hidden information about
  the biomedical interactions such as Protein-Protein, Drug-Drug and Protein-Drug.
  Recently, there is an increased interest in automated methods due to the vast growth
  in the volume of published text regarding biomedical interactions. This work mainly
  focuses on extraction of Drug- Drug interactions (DDIs) in biomedical research articles
  from well-known databases such as DrugBank and MedLine. The proposed approach is
  developed based on feature engineering through natural language processing (NLP)
  techniques such as bag-of-words approach, tokenization, part-of-speech (POS) tagging,
  lemmatization and so on. This uncomplicated and easy to implement set of features
  are combined into a feature vector which is used to train a machine learning model.
  The effectiveness of the proposed approach was measured by conducting several experiments
  on the “DDI Extraction 2013” corpus. The system showed encouraging F-measure value
  of 76.9%.
