 abstract = {This paper describes our system, SciREL (Sci-
entific abstract RELation extraction system),
developed for the SemEval 2018 Task 7: Se-
mantic Relation Extraction and Classification
in Scientific Papers. We present a feature-
vector based system to extract explicit se-
mantic relation and classify them. Our sys-
tem is trained in the ACL corpus (Bird et al.,
2008) that contains annotated abstracts given
by the task organizers. When an abstract with
annotated entities is given as the input into
our system, it extracts the semantic relations
through a set of defined features and classi-
fies them into one of the given six categories
of relations through feature engineering and
a learned model. For the best combination
of features our system SciREL obtained an F-
measure of 20.03 on the official test corpus in
the relation classification Subtask 1.1. In this
paper, we provide an in-depth error analysis of
our results to prevent duplication of research
efforts in the development of future systems.},
