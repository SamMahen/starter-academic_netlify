abstract: 'This paper describes our system, SciREL (Scientific abstract RELation
  extraction system), developed for the SemEval 2018 Task 7: Semantic Relation Extraction
  and Classification in Scientific Papers. We present a feature-vector based system
  to extract explicit semantic relation and classify them. Our system is trained
  in the ACL corpus (Bird et al., 2008) that contains annotated abstracts given by
  the task organizers. When an abstract with annotated entities is given as the input
  into our system, it extracts the semantic relations through a set of defined features
  and classifies them into one of the given six categories of relations through
  feature engineering and a learned model. For the best combination of features our
  system SciREL obtained an F-measure of 20.03 on the official test corpus in the
  relation classification Subtask 1.1. In this paper, we provide an in-depth error
  analysis of our results to prevent duplication of research efforts in the development
  of future systems.'
