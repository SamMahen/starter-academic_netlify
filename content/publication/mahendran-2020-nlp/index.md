abstract: This paper describes our participation in the Social Media Mining for Health
  Application (SMM4H 2020) Challenge Track 2 for identifying tweets containing Adverse
  Effects (AEs). Our system uses Convolutional Neural Networks. We explore downsampling,
  oversampling, and adjusting the class weights to account for the imbalanced nature
  of the dataset. Our results showed downsampling outperformed oversampling and adjusting
  the class weights on the test set however all three obtained similar results on
  the development set.
