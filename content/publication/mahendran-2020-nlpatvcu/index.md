abstract: 'This paper describes our teamâ€™s participation in the Tracks 1 & 2 from
  Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF 2020) Challenge organized by Cheminformatics
  Elsevier Melbourne University for extracting information over chemical reactions
  from patents. We dis- cuss our systems: MedaCy, a python-based supervised multi-class
  entity recognition system, and RelEx, a python-based relation extraction sys- tem
  which includes rule-based and supervised learning pipelines. Our best model for
  Task 1 obtained an overall relaxed precision of 0.95 and exact precision of 0.87;
  relaxed recall of 0.99 and exact recall of 0.86; and relaxed F 1 score of 0.97 and
  exact F 1 score of 0.87. Our best model for Task 2 obtained an overall precision
  of 0.80; recall of 0.54; and F 1 score of 0.65.'
