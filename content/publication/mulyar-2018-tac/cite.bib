 abstract = {This draft paper describes our participa-
tion in the TAC SRIE 2018 Challenge for
extracting experimental design factors for
the systematic review process from the
method section of biomedical journal ar-
ticles. We discuss our system, medaCy, a
python-based supervised multi-class clas-
sification system that uses Conditional
Random Fields. Our system place fourth
for the challenge. The results show that
we are better able to identify Animal and
Dose Group design factors than Exposure
and Endpoint. This paper includes an anal-
ysis of our results and future directions to
improve the extraction.},
