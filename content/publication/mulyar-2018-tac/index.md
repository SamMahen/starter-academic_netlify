abstract: This draft paper describes our participation in the TAC SRIE 2018 Challenge
  for extracting experimental design factors for the systematic review process from
  the method section of biomedical journal articles. We discuss our system, medaCy,
  a python-based supervised multi-class classification system that uses Conditional
  Random Fields. Our system place fourth for the challenge. The results show that
  we are better able to identify Animal and Dose Group design factors than Exposure
  and Endpoint. This paper includes an analysis of our results and future directions
  to improve the extraction.
